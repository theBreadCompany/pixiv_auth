## pixiv_auth.py for headless integration

This repository hosts my headless version of [ZipFile's pixiv_auth.py script](https://gist.github.com/upbit/6edda27cb1644e94183291109b8a5fde) for headless integration into your script. This can be used to obtain a refresh token for authentication with the PixivAPI of your choice. I might be switching to another browser framework to cut down size.
